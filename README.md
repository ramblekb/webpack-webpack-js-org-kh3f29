[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/webpack-webpack-js-org-kh3f29)

Ok, so this app is built to help those who log into old devices that are slow and the GUI is no so good. So were going to build an Model View Controller for the old Camera in the wharehouse. I was asked to pin point some files on the camera and start setting up CRUD operations for them. We'll the are buring in this jammed up array that that doesn't have any functionality so going in from the front isn't the way to go. I need to go in on its LINUX system and and make some commands. To get the info. Ok so can I set up the for the operations to happen?
What kind of TRanspot will I need to oppoate?
cli commands to read, write, delete or update a file on a linux machine and what kind of transport is that therefor what type of crud opperation should I make? I think it's HTTP?
